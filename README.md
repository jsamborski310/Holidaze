# Usage:

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

Once the user has typed in a specific holiday they are presented with information pertaining to that holiday.
