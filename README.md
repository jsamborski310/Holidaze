# Usage:

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

Once the user has typed in a specific holiday they are presented with information pertaining to that holiday. If the pop up box is clicked the user will be redirected to another page that contains more info on the searched holiday and in addition to that the user will be offered a random historic event that took place on the current day.
